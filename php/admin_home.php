                Animals should not be caged, to help them adjust to the environment. We should also teach others to love pets. If we don't know the behaviour aspect of some 
                unfamiliar animals, we should not approach them. If we are visiting any wildlife area, we should research on its flora and fauna to know about the animals and their 
                nature.

                the four nominees for the ICC Women's T20I Player of the Year. The ICC Awards 2021 will recognise the outstanding achievements and feats in cricket over the past 
                year. In a year that saw India win only two of the nine T20Is, Smriti Mandhana was one of their few bright spots.</p>
