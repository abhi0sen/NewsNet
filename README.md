# NewsNet - Newspaper Network

This project regularly publishes articles, news or advertisement in various newspapers and is aimed at people who may face problems like 
•	There are no reporters at the right time. 
•	Line up in long lines to print emails. 
•	Do not recognize the fixed price at the time of booking. 
•	I don`t know the status of my stuffs getting printed or not. 
To solve this, we devised a website that allows users to easily post their content and perform the entire process from sending content to printing an email. All he has to do is open the website and log in to his account to see if his previous post has been deleted
We will be asking user about what he wants to share between article, advertisement or news and then based on the respective option we will ask him to enter details of their stuff. If it is an article then it will be directly posted to the newspaper mail id and if it is advertisement or news then user would need to wait for the approval of his post and once the post gets approval, he will be asked to pay fees of that particular lines of post. After paying the fees, his post will be ready to get printed.
